This project will automatically enrol a student in a given tutorial at the correct time by sending
POST data to sols.

POST data was manually observed using Firefox with the Tamper Data extension.

Note that is seems that when a session modifies information on Sols' database, it will invalidate
all other sessions.

Testing cannot really be done until enrolment opens...
